<br><h2>About Me</h2><br>

<p>
Hi, I’m <strong>Muhammad Shayan</strong> — a passionate <strong>Frontend Developer</strong> and 
a BSCS student from Karachi. I enjoy turning ideas into clean, responsive, and 
user-friendly websites. My focus is on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, but I’m 
always learning new tools and frameworks to grow as a developer. 
</p>
<p>
Beyond coding, I’m also exploring graphic design and UI/UX to make my projects 
both functional and visually appealing. I believe in continuous learning, 
collaboration, and building solutions that matter.
